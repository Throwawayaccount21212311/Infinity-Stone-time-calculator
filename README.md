# Infinity-Stone-time-calculator.

A calculator for infinity stone charge time for the game 'The Perfect Tower 2'. Written in Python 3, feel free to change however you want. Can take anywhere between a few seconds and a few hours to run.

WARNING: The calculator does not work, I have uploaded it to GitHub so that people can help fix the bugs.
