# Infinity-Stone-time-calculator.

A calculator for infinity stone charge time for the game 'The Perfect Tower 2'. Written in Python 3, feel free to change however you want. Can take anywhere between a few seconds and a few hours to run.

either copy and paste the code or download it into an interpreter or similar to run it. I recommend using the PyCharm interpreter, which can be found here:

Installation guide: https://www.guru99.com/how-to-install-python.html
After following the installation guide, download the files here, open 'Calculator.py' in the interpreter, and run it.
